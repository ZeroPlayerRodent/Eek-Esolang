# Eek-Esolang
An esolang where the code looks like incoherent screeching!

This is a fully usable and Turing complete programming language, just with WACKY SYNTAX!

You can find documentation for the language [on the esolangs wiki.](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Eek!)

(The "install.sh" file will install dependencies and make Eek! executable.)
